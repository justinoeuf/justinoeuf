The first book was adapted from the first four radio episodes (the Primary Phase), with Arthur being rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford, meeting Zaphod and Trillian, coming to the planet of Magrathea to discover the true purpose of Earth, and ending with the group preparing to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by [Pan Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Books "Pan Books"), after [BBC Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Publishing "BBC Publishing") had turned down the offer of publishing a novelization, an action they would later regret.^[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#cite_note-28)^ The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,000 copies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of [Random House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_House "Random House") in the United States in October 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine *[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)")* to build [word of mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth "Word of mouth"). In 2005, Del Rey Books re-released the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. To date, it has sold over 14 million copies.^[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#cite_note-29)^

A [photo-illustrated edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)) of the first novel appeared in 1994.
