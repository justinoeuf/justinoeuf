Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, drawing a then-NL record 1.8 million fans. The Braves finished 92--62 in their first season in Milwaukee. The success of the relocated team showed that baseball could succeed in new markets, and the [Philadelphia Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics "Philadelphia Athletics"), [St. Louis Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_St._Louis_Browns "History of the St. Louis Browns"), [Brooklyn Dodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers "Rockford Forest Citys"), and [New York Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants_(NL) "New York Giants (NL)") left their hometowns within the next five years.

As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers [Eddie Mathews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mathews "Eddie Mathews") and [Hank Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron "Hank Aaron") drove the offense (they hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee and 863 coming while they were teammates), often aided by another power hitter, [Joe Adcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Adcock "Joe Adcock"), while [Warren Spahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spahn "Warren Spahn"), [Lew Burdette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Burdette "Lew Burdette"), and [Bob Buhl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Buhl "Bob Buhl") anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.

In [1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Milwaukee_Braves_season "1957 Milwaukee Braves season"), the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's [MVP season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award "MLB Most Valuable Player Award"), as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run [walk-off home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run "Walk-off home run") that gave the Braves a 4--2 victory over the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_St._Louis_Cardinals_season "1957 St. Louis Cardinals season") and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series "World Series") win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_New_York_Yankees_season "1957 New York Yankees season") of [Berra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Berra "Yogi Berra"), [Mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mantle "Mickey Mantle"), and [Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitey_Ford "Whitey Ford") in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete-game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.

In [1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Milwaukee_Braves_season "1958 Milwaukee Braves season"), the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_New_York_Yankees_season "1958 New York Yankees season") once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [Bob Turley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Turley "Bob Turley")'s pitching.

The [1959 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Milwaukee_Braves_season "1959 Milwaukee Braves season") saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the [Los Angeles Dodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season "1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season"), both with 86--68 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 miles (121 km) apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [Chicago White Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Chicago_White_Sox_season "1959 Chicago White Sox season") in the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_World_Series "1959 World Series").

The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season "1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season"), who went on to win the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series "1960 World Series") that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher [Harvey Haddix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Haddix "Harvey Haddix"). The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Aaron hit 45 [home runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run "Home run") in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. [The next season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_in_baseball "1963 in baseball"), Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and 42-year-old Warren Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23--7. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the "[second division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_division_(baseball) "First division (baseball)")", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Braves were mediocre as the 1960s began, with an inflated win total fed by the expansion [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets "New York Mets") and [Houston Colt .45s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Colt_.45s "Houston Colt .45s"). To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team that played more than one season and never had a losing record.

Perini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by [William Bartholomay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bartholomay "William Bartholomay") in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor [Ivan Allen Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Allen_Jr. "Ivan Allen Jr.") constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, [Atlanta Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Stadium "Atlanta Stadium"), which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the [Kansas City A's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Oakland_Athletics#Kansas_City_(1955%E2%80%931967) "History of the Oakland Athletics") to Atlanta (the A's ultimately moved to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.

[Eddie Mathews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mathews "Eddie Mathews") is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.
