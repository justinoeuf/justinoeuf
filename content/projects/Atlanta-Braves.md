#### 1966--1974[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: 1966--1974")]

An away jersey worn by Hank Aaron in 1969.

The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85--77 in 1966, 77--85 in 1967, and 81--81 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever [National League West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West "1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season") Division title, before being swept by the "[Miracle Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season "1969 New York Mets season")" in the [National League Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_National_League_Championship_Series). They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 -- in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.

The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of [Center Parc Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Parc_Stadium "Center Parc Stadium").

In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [Hank Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron "Philadelphia Phillies"). In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in [Rico Carty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Carty) (in 1970) and [Ralph Garr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Garr "Ralph Garr") (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 -- [Darrell Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Evans "Darrell Evans") and [Davey Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davey_Johnson "Davey Johnson") along with Aaron.

By the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. On April 4, opening day of the [next season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Major_League_Baseball_season "1974 Major League Baseball season"), he hit No.714 in [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cincinnati_Reds_season "1974 Cincinnati Reds season"), and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander [Al Downing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Downing_(baseball) "Al Downing (baseball)") of the [Los Angeles Dodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season "1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season"). Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the [Milwaukee Brewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers "Milwaukee Brewers") on November 2, 1974.

#### 1976--1977: Ted Turner buys the team[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: 1976--1977: Ted Turner buys the team")]

Media magnate [Ted Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner "Ted Turner") purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team's operation.

In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate [Ted Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner "Ted Turner"), owner of [superstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstation "Superstation") [WTBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_(TV_network) "TBS (TV network)"), as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed [Atlanta--Fulton County Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton_County_Stadium "Atlanta--Fulton County Stadium"). Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself [manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball) "Manager (baseball)"), but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the [Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Atlanta_Braves_season "1977 Atlanta Braves season") lost 2--1 to the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season "1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season") to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: [America's Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Team "America's Team")", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially [the South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"). Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher [Andy Messersmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Messersmith "Andy Messersmith") and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired [Braves games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braves_TBS_Baseball "Braves TBS Baseball"). Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.

#### 1978--1990[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 1978--1990")]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Phil_Niekro_1982.jpg/220px-Phil_Niekro_1982.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phil_Niekro_1982.jpg)

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phil_Niekro_1982.jpg "Enlarge")

[Phil Niekro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Niekro "Phil Niekro") played with the Braves from 1964 to 1983 and in 1987; he holds the MLB record for most wins by a [knuckleball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckleball "Knuckleball") pitcher

After three straight losing seasons, [Bobby Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Cox "Bobby Cox") was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger [Dale Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Murphy "Dale Murphy") into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with [Joe Torre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Torre), under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [Bob Horner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Horner "Bob Horner"), [Chris Chambliss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chambliss "1969 National League Championship Series"), pitcher [Phil Niekro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Niekro "Phil Niekro"), and short relief pitcher [Gene Garber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Garber "Gene Garber") helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [Most Valuable Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_award "MLB Most Valuable Player award") and a [Gold Glove award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award "Gold Glove Award"). Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as [general manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball) "General manager (baseball)"). Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot, [Chief Noc-A-Homa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Noc-A-Homa "Chief Noc-A-Homa").

#### 1991--2005: Division dominance[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 1991--2005: Division dominance")]

##### 1991--1994[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: 1991--1994")]

[![John Smoltz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/JohnSmoltz.jpg/175px-JohnSmoltz.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JohnSmoltz.jpg)

[Greg Maddux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Maddux "Greg Maddux"), [Tom Glavine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Glavine "Tom Glavine"), and [John Smoltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smoltz "John Smoltz") combined for six [Cy Young Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award "Cy Young Award") during their time in the Braves pitching rotation

Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing [Russ Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Nixon "Russ Nixon"). The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65--97. They traded Dale Murphy to the [Philadelphia Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies "Philadelphia Phillies") after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach [Leo Mazzone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mazzone "Leo Mazzone") began developing young pitchers [Tom Glavine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Glavine "Tom Glavine"), [Steve Avery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Avery_(baseball) "Steve Avery (baseball)"), and [John Smoltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smoltz "John Smoltz") into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the [1990 MLB draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Major_League_Baseball_draft "1990 Major League Baseball draft") to select [Chipper Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones "Chipper Jones"), who became one of the best hitters in team history.^[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-26)^ Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [John Schuerholz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schuerholz "John Schuerholz") was hired away from the [Kansas City Royals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals "Kansas City Royals") as general manager.

The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players [David Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Justice "David Justice"), [Ron Gant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Gant "Ron Gant") and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion [Terry Pendleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pendleton "Terry Pendleton"), the [Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Atlanta_Braves_season "1991 Atlanta Braves season") overcame a 39--40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the [Los Angeles Dodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season "1991 Los Angeles Dodgers season") by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season "1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season") in a very tightly contested seven-game [NLCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_National_League_Championship_Series "1991 National League Championship Series") only to lose the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_World_Series "1991 World Series"), also in seven games, to the [Minnesota Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Minnesota_Twins_season "1991 Minnesota Twins season"). The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.

Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the [Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Atlanta_Braves_season "1992 Atlanta Braves season") returned to the [NLCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_National_League_Championship_Series "1992 National League Championship Series") and once again defeated the [Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season "1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season") in seven games, culminating in a [dramatic game seven win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cabrera_game "Francisco Cabrera game"). [Francisco Cabrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cabrera_(baseball) "Francisco Cabrera (baseball)")'s two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3--2 victory. It was the first time in post-season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_World_Series "1992 World Series") to the [Toronto Blue Jays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Toronto_Blue_Jays_season "1992 Toronto Blue Jays season"), however. In 1993, the Braves signed [Cy Young Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award "Cy Young Award") winning pitcher [Greg Maddux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Maddux "Greg Maddux") from the [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs "Chicago Cubs"), leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.^[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-27)^ The [1993 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Atlanta_Braves_season "1993 Atlanta Braves season") posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the [San Francisco Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_San_Francisco_Giants_season "1993 San Francisco Giants season"), who won 103 games.^[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-28)^ The Braves needed a stunning 55--19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the [NLCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_National_League_Championship_Series "1993 National League Championship Series") to the [Philadelphia Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Philadelphia_Phillies_season "1993 Philadelphia Phillies season") in six games.

In 1994, in a realignment of the [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League "National League")'s divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.^[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-Realignment-29)^ This realignment was the main cause of the team's [heated rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braves%E2%80%93Mets_rivalry "Braves--Mets rivalry") with the [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets "New York Mets") during the mid-to-late 1990s.^[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-RivalryWithMets-30)^^[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-SubwaySeries-31)^^[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-32)^

The [player's strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Major_League_Baseball_strike "1994--95 Major League Baseball strike") cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the [Montreal Expos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Montreal_Expos_season "1994 Montreal Expos season") with 48 games left to play.

##### 1995--2005[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: 1995--2005")]

The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the [Cleveland Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Cleveland_Indians_season "1995 Cleveland Indians season") in the [1995 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_World_Series "1995 World Series").^[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-33)^ This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "[Buffalo Bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills "Buffalo Bills") of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of *Beckett [Baseball Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Card "Baseball Card") Monthly*). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_World_Series "1996 World Series") and [1999 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_World_Series "1999 World Series") (losing both to the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees "New York Yankees"), managed by [Joe Torre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Torre "Joe Torre"), a former Braves manager),^[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-SubwaySeries-31)^ and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization ---Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

In October 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's [Turner Broadcasting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System "Turner Broadcasting System") and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves. Over the next few years, Ted Turner's presence as the owner of the team would diminish.

A 95--67 record in [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_World_Series "2000 World Series") produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep by the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_St._Louis_Cardinals_season "2000 St. Louis Cardinals season") in the [National League Division Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_National_League_Division_Series "2000 National League Division Series") prevented the Braves from reaching the [NL Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_National_League_Championship_Series "2000 National League Championship Series").^[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-SubwaySeries-31)^

In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the [Houston Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros "Houston Astros") in the NLDS, then lost to the [Arizona Diamondbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks "Arizona Diamondbacks") in the [National League Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_National_League_Championship_Series "2001 National League Championship Series") four games to one. One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played [rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braves%E2%80%93Mets_rivalry "Braves--Mets rivalry") [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets "New York Mets") in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks").

In 2002, 2003, and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the [San Francisco Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_San_Francisco_Giants_season "2002 San Francisco Giants season"), [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Chicago_Cubs_season "2003 Chicago Cubs season"), and [Houston Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Houston_Astros_season "2004 Houston Astros season").

Six National League [Cy Young Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award "Cy Young Award") in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:

-   In 1991, left-handed pitcher [Tom Glavine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Glavine "Tom Glavine") received his first award.
-   Right-handed pitcher [Greg Maddux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Maddux "Greg Maddux") won four in a row, three of them with the Braves from 1993 through 1995. His first award came in 1992 with the Cubs.
-   In 1996, right-handed pitcher [John Smoltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smoltz "John Smoltz") received his only Cy Young Award.
-   In 1998, Glavine won his second.

##### 2005: A new generation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: 2005: A new generation")]

In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. The 14 consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ([Wilson Betemit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Betemit "Wilson Betemit"), [Brian McCann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McCann_(baseball) "Brian McCann (baseball)"), [Pete Orr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Orr "Pete Orr"), [Ryan Langerhans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Langerhans "Ryan Langerhans"), [Jeff Francoeur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Francoeur "Jeff Francoeur")).^[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^ Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher [Kyle Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Davies_(baseball) "Kyle Davies (baseball)") all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90--72.

However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the [National League Division Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_National_League_Division_Series "2005 National League Division Series") to the [Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Houston_Astros_season "2005 Houston Astros season") in four games. In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a [Lance Berkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Berkman "Lance Berkman") [grand slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball) "Grand slam (baseball)") and a two-out, ninth-inning [Brad Ausmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Ausmus "Brad Ausmus") home run off of Braves closer [Kyle Farnsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Farnsworth "Kyle Farnsworth"). The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes. [Chris Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Burke_(baseball) "Chris Burke (baseball)") ended the marathon with a home run off of [Joey Devine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Devine "Joey Devine").

After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach [Leo Mazzone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mazzone "Leo Mazzone"), who left to go to the [Baltimore Orioles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles "Baltimore Orioles"). [Roger McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McDowell "Roger McDowell") took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop [Rafael Furcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Furcal "Rafael Furcal"), the Braves acquired shortstop [Édgar Rentería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89dgar_Renter%C3%ADa "Édgar Rentería") from the Boston Red Sox.

#### 2006: Struggles[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: 2006: Struggles")]

Main article: [2006 Atlanta Braves season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Atlanta_Braves_season "2006 Atlanta Braves season")

In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6--21 record during June, the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful [Boston Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935_Boston_Braves_season "1935 Boston Braves season") in May 1935 (4--20) with a .166 winning percentage.

After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the [Boston Beaneaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1897_Boston_Beaneaters_season "1897 Boston Beaneaters season") totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 -- June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the [1930 New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_New_York_Yankees_season "1930 New York Yankees season") to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8--3 victory over [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Cincinnati_Reds_season "2006 Cincinnati Reds season") on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie [Paul Waner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Waner "Paul Waner")'s 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.^[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-34)^

However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the [Florida Marlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Florida_Marlins_season "2006 Florida Marlins season") mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East. On September 24, the Braves' loss to the [Colorado Rockies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Colorado_Rockies_season "2006 Colorado Rockies season") mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season. Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie [Chuck James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_James "Chuck James") besting [Roger Clemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens "Roger Clemens"), Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79--83.

#### Sale to Liberty Media[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Sale to Liberty Media")]

In December 2005, team owner [Time Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner "Time Warner"), which inherited the Braves after purchasing [Turner Broadcasting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System "Turner Broadcasting System") in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.^[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-35)^^[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-36)^ [Liberty Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Media "Liberty Media") began negotiations to purchase the team.

In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal to sell the Braves to Liberty Media, which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner, pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, [Bud Selig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Selig "Bud Selig"). The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty, worth approximately $1.48 billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves, and Liberty did not participate in day-to-day operations.^[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-37)^ On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale.^[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-BravesSaleApproved-4)^^[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-38)^ The Braves are one of only two Major League Baseball teams under majority corporate ownership (and the only NL team with this distinction); the other team is the [Toronto Blue Jays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays "Toronto Blue Jays") (owned by Canadian media conglomerate [Rogers Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications "Rogers Communications")).

On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder [Garret Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret_Anderson "Garret Anderson"). The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade [Josh Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Anderson_(baseball) "Josh Anderson (baseball)") to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher [Rudy Darrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudy_Darrow&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rudy Darrow (page does not exist)") on March 30, 2009.^[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-41)^

The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading [Colorado Rockies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Colorado_Rockies_season "2009 Colorado Rockies season") in late September. On October 1, 2009, with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the [Milwaukee Brewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Milwaukee_Brewers_season "2009 Milwaukee Brewers season") 9--2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.

Braves manager [Bobby Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Cox "Bobby Cox") retired in 2010 after 25 years of management

The 2010 Braves' season featured an attempt to reclaim a [postseason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postseason "Postseason") berth for the first time since [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlanta_Braves_season "2005 Atlanta Braves season"). The Braves were once again skippered by [Bobby Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Cox "Bobby Cox"), in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Atlanta_Braves_season "2000 Atlanta Braves season") when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place [Philadelphia Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies "Philadelphia Phillies") at [Turner Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Field "Turner Field") to take sole possession of first place in the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East "National League East") standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.^[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-42)^ The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlanta_Braves_season "2005 Atlanta Braves season").

##### September collapse[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: September collapse")]

The Braves led the [National League Wild Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_Wild_Card_winners "List of National League Wild Card winners") standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival [Philadelphia Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies) firmly in control of first place in the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East "National League East"). The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500 with a record of 80--55 and an 8+1⁄2-game lead in the Wild Card standings. The nearest team trailing them, the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_St._Louis_Cardinals_season "2011 St. Louis Cardinals season"), who also trailed the [National League Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central)-leading [Milwaukee Brewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers "Milwaukee Brewers") by 8+1⁄2 games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason. Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves 10+1⁄2 games behind and in third place.^[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-53)^

With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9--18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89--73. The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18--8 to finish at 90--72. Braves closer [Craig Kimbrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel "Craig Kimbrel"), who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man [Jonny Venters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Venters "Jonny Venters") posted a 5.11 September ERA. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager [Fredi González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredi_Gonz%C3%A1lez "Fredi González").^[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-54)^ Veteran starter [Derek Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Lowe "Terry Pendleton") posted a [win-loss record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-loss_record "Win-loss record") of 0--5 in September with an ERA of 8.75.^[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-AJC_chronology-55)^ Shortly into the offseason, Lowe would be traded to the [Cleveland Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians "Cleveland Indians").^[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-56)^ The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games.^[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-AJC_chronology-55)^ Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.^[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-collapse_complete-57)^ Braves catcher [Brian McCann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McCann_(baseball) "Brian McCann (baseball)"), often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September.^[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-AJC_chronology-55)^ The offense as a whole hit for only a .235 [batting average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball) "Batting average (baseball)") and a .300 [on-base percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage "On-base percentage") in September, both second-worst in the [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League "National League").

#### 2012: Chipper's last season[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: 2012: Chipper's last season")]

Chipper Jones salutes the crowd at [Turner Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Field "Turner Field") prior to his final regular-season game on September 30, 2012. Jones announced he would retire after 19 seasons with the Braves

In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman [Chipper Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones "Chipper Jones") would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.^[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-59)^ The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher [Derek Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Lowe "Derek Lowe"), shortstop [Alex González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_Gonz%C3%A1lez_(shortstop,_born_1977) "Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)"), and outfielder [Nate McLouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_McLouth "Nate McLouth"). To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder [Michael Bourn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bourn "Michael Bourn"), along with shortstops [Tyler Pastornicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Pastornicky "Tyler Pastornicky") and [Andrelton Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrelton_Simmons "Andrelton Simmons"). To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to [Brandon Beachy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Beachy "Brandon Beachy")), manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher [Kris Medlen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Medlen "Kris Medlen") to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the [Washington Nationals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals "Washington Nationals") in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild-card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a [playoff game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_National_League_Wild_Card_Game "2012 National League Wild Card Game") before entering into the [Division Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_Series "Division Series").

The Braves played the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals "St. Louis Cardinals") in the first-ever [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game "Major League Baseball Wild Card Game"). The Braves were behind 6--3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder. Umpire [Sam Holbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Holbrook "Sam Holbrook") called Simmons out, citing the [infield fly rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_fly_rule "Infield fly rule"). Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6--3, ending their season.

#### 2013: Braves win the East[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: 2013: Braves win the East")]

Main article: [2013 Atlanta Braves season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Atlanta_Braves_season "2013 Atlanta Braves season")

Following a gut-wrenching exit against the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals "St. Louis Cardinals") in the [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game "Major League Baseball Wild Card Game"), the Braves spent the 2012--2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense. The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring [B.J. Upton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.J._Upton "B.J. Upton") from the [Tampa Bay Rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays "Tampa Bay Rays"), signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder,^[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-60)^ and uniting him with his younger brother [Justin Upton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Upton "Justin Upton") from the [Arizona Diamondbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks "Arizona Diamondbacks") in a seven-player trade that sent fan favorite utility man [Martín Prado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart%C3%ADn_Prado "Martín Prado") to the Diamondbacks,^[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-61)^ they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in [Chris Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Johnson_(baseball) "Chris Johnson (baseball)") after the retirement of [Chipper Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones "Chipper Jones") the previous year. The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17--9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation [Evan Gattis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gattis "Evan Gattis"), while taking hold of first place in the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East "National League East") division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season. The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to [Jason Heyward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward "Jason Heyward"), [Brian McCann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McCann_(baseball) "Brian McCann (baseball)"), [Freddie Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman "Freddie Freeman"), [Eric O'Flaherty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_O%27Flaherty "Eric O'Flaherty"), [Jonny Venters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Venters "Jonny Venters"), [Ramiro Pena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiro_Pena "Ramiro Pena") and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team. Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman Freddie Freeman was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play. The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher [Julio Teherán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Teher%C3%A1n "Julio Teherán") after much hype during Spring training. From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.^[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-62)^ The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April--May 2000.

On June 28, 2013, the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey, number 10, before the game against the [Arizona Diamondbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks "Arizona Diamondbacks"). He was honored before 51,300 fans at [Turner Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Field "Turner Field") in [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta").^[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-63)^ He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. [Chipper Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones "Chipper Jones") played his last regular-season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.

The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the [Washington Nationals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals "Washington Nationals") in the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East "National League East") on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles. This was also Braves manager [Fredi González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredi_Gonz%C3%A1lez "Fredi González")'s first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season. The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013^[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-64)^ after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs "Chicago Cubs") 5--2 at [Wrigley Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field "Wrigley Field").

After clinching the division title, they lost to the Dodgers 3--1 in the Division Series.

[Jason Heyward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward "Jason Heyward") runs the bases in 2014

On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a [new stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunTrust_Park "SunTrust Park") in [Cobb County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_County "Cobb County"), in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017. The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016. The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership.^[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-65)^^[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-66)^^[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-67)^^[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-68)^^[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-69)^^[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-70)^^[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-71)^ During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts; Craig Kimbrel (4 years/$42 million), Freddie Freeman (8 years/$135M), Kris Medlen (1 year/$5.8M), Jason Heyward (2 years/$13.3M), Julio Teherán (6 years/$32.4M) and Andrelton Simmons (7 years/$58M).

The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79--83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.

#### 2015--2016: Rebuilding[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlanta_Braves&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: 2015--2016: Rebuilding")]

Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired general manager [Frank Wren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wren "Frank Wren"), and [John Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hart_(baseball) "John Hart (baseball)") replaced him as interim general manager, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations. The Braves promptly traded [Gold Glove Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award "Gold Glove Award") winner [Jason Heyward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward "Jason Heyward") to the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals "St. Louis Cardinals") along with pitcher [Jordan Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Walden "Jordan Walden") for pitchers [Shelby Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Miller "Shelby Miller") and [Tyrell Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrell_Jenkins "Tyrell Jenkins").^[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-72)^ Hart traded All-Star left fielder [Justin Upton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Upton "Justin Upton") to the [San Diego Padres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres "San Diego Padres") for [Max Fried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Fried "Max Fried"), [Jace Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jace_Peterson "Jace Peterson"), [Dustin Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Peterson "Dustin Peterson"), and [Mallex Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallex_Smith "Mallex Smith").^[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-73)^ Catcher [Evan Gattis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gattis "Evan Gattis") and minor league [prospect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_(sports) "Prospect (sports)") [James Hoyt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hoyt_(baseball) "James Hoyt (baseball)") were traded to the [Houston Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros "Houston Astros") for minor leaguers [Mike Foltynewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Foltynewicz "Mike Foltynewicz"), [Rio Ruiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ruiz "Rio Ruiz"), and [Andrew Thurman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Thurman "Andrew Thurman").^[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-74)^ A day before the season began, the Braves made a final trade involving former All-Star [Craig Kimbrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel "Craig Kimbrel") and outfielder [Melvin Upton Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Upton_Jr. "Melvin Upton Jr."). They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders [Cameron Maybin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Maybin "Cameron Maybin") and [Carlos Quentin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Quentin "Carlos Quentin") along with two minor league players.^[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-75)^ By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Prior to the start of the 2016 regular season, the Braves continued their offseason rebuilding by trading [Andrelton Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrelton_Simmons "Andrelton Simmons") to the Los Angeles Angels for [Erick Aybar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Aybar "Erick Aybar") and pitching prospects [Sean Newcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Newcomb "Sean Newcomb") and [Chris Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ellis_(baseball) "Chris Ellis (baseball)") and $2.5 million. They agreed to one-year contracts with [Kelly Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(baseball) "Kelly Johnson (baseball)"), [Chris Withrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Withrow "Chris Withrow"), and [Arodys Vizcaino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arodys_Vizcaino "Arodys Vizcaino"), and agreed to terms on a minor league contract for [Carlos Torres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Torres_(pitcher) "Carlos Torres (pitcher)") and [Jeff Francoeur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Francoeur "Jeff Francoeur"). The Braves purchased the major league contract of Francoeur.

On April 13, 2016, Hector Olivera was arrested and charged with the assault of a woman at the team hotel when the Braves were in Washington D.C. facing the Nationals. He was placed on administrative leave by MLB and was placed on the Braves restricted list.^[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-76)^

The Braves began the season on a nine-game losing streak, which is the worst opening by the franchise since 1988, when they dropped the first 10 games of that season.

After a 9--28 start in 2016, Fredi González was fired on May 17 and replaced by [Gwinnett Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwinnett_Braves "Gwinnett Braves")' manager [Brian Snitker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Snitker "Brian Snitker") as interim manager.

SunTrust Park (now [Truist Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park "Truist Park")) prior to its first regular-season game

The Braves opened their new stadium, SunTrust Park (now [Truist Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park "Truist Park")), on April 14, 2017, with a four-game sweep of the [San Diego Padres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres "San Diego Padres"). The park received positive reviews. Woody Studenmund of the [Hardball Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardball_Times "Hardball Times") called the park a "gem" saying that he was impressed with "the compact beauty of the stadium and its exciting approach to combining baseball, business and social activities."^[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-htreview-79)^ J.J.
