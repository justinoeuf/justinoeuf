The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-BravesHistory-14">[13]</a>^ (The only other team that has been organized as long, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, did not play for the two years following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" title="Great Chicago Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford_Forest_Citys">Forest City club</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford,_Illinois" title="2020 Major League Baseball season">Rockford, Illinois</a>, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Spalding" title="Albert Spalding">Al Spalding</a> (founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalding_(sports_equipment)" title="Spalding (sports equipment)">Spalding</a> sporting goods) and second baseman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Barnes" title="Ross Barnes">Ross Barnes</a>.</p>
<p>Led by the Wright brothers, Barnes, and Spalding, the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league&rsquo;s five championships. The team became one of the National League&rsquo;s charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the &ldquo;<em>Red Caps</em>&rdquo; (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member).</p>

<p>Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League&rsquo;s inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league&rsquo;s dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)" title="Manager (baseball)">manager</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Selee" title="Frank Selee">Frank Selee</a>. Boston came to be called the <em>Beaneaters</em> in 1883 while retaining red as the team color. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1898_Boston_Beaneaters_season" title="1898 Boston Beaneaters season">1898 team</a> finished 102&ndash;47, a club record for wins that would stand for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Atlanta_Braves_season" title="1993 Atlanta Braves season">almost a century</a>. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the &ldquo;Heavenly Twins&rdquo;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Duffy" title="Hugh Duffy">Hugh Duffy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_McCarthy" title="Tommy McCarthy">Tommy McCarthy</a>, as well as &ldquo;Slidin'&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Hamilton_(baseball,_born_1866)" title="Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1866)">Billy Hamilton</a>.</p>
<p>The team was decimated when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League" title="American League">American League</a>&rsquo;s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913 and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in <em>The Sporting News Baseball Guide</em> during the 1940s when each team&rsquo;s entry had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball_team_nicknames" title="History of baseball team nicknames">history of its nickname(s)</a>. The American League club&rsquo;s owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" title="Boston Red Sox">Red Sox</a> as his team&rsquo;s first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic &ldquo;Americans&rdquo;). Media-driven nickname changes to the <em>Doves</em> in 1907 and the <em>Rustlers</em> in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club&rsquo;s luck. The team became the <em>Braves</em> for the first time before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Boston_Braves_season" title="1912 Boston Braves season">1912 season</a>.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-bgbraves-20">[18]</a>^ The president of the club, John M.

<p>Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4&ndash;18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last-place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1914_Brooklyn_Dodgers_season" title="1914 Brooklyn Dodgers season">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. The consecutive losses put their record at 26&ndash;40 and the Braves were in last place, <em>15 games</em> behind the league-leading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1914_New_York_Giants_season" title="1914 New York Giants season">New York Giants</a>, who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41&ndash;12.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-22">[20]</a>^ On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16&ndash;16.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-23">[21]</a>^ They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-24">[22]</a>^</p>
<p>Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1914_World_Series" title="1914 World Series">World Series</a> as a heavy underdog to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Mack" title="Connie Mack">Connie Mack</a>&lsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1914_Philadelphia_Athletics_season" title="1914 Philadelphia Athletics season">Philadelphia A&rsquo;s</a>. Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics&mdash;the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series" title="World Series">World Series</a> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_World_Series" title="1907 World Series">1907 Series</a> had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Evers" title="Johnny Evers">Johnny Evers</a> won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award">Chalmers Award</a>.</p>
<p>The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a>, since their normal home, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_End_Grounds" title="South End Grounds">South End Grounds</a>, was too small. However, the Braves&rsquo; success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braves_Field" title="Braves Field">Braves Field</a>, which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.</p>

</h4>
<p>After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Fuchs_(baseball)" title="Emil Fuchs (baseball)">Emil Fuchs</a> bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Mathewson" title="Christy Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.</p>
<p>Fuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKechnie" title="Bill McKechnie">Bill McKechnie</a>, but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p>Looking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> to acquire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down&mdash;perhaps as early as 1936.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-Neyer-25">[23]</a>^</p>
<p>At first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4&ndash;2 win over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_New_York_Giants_(MLB)_season" title="1936 New York Giants (MLB) season">Giants</a>. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of <em>his</em> money in the team.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-Neyer-25">[23]</a>^</p>
<p>Seeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1&mdash;only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run" title="Home run">home runs</a> of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-Neyer-25">[23]</a>^ The Braves finished 38&ndash;115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is the second-worst in the modern era and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899_Cleveland_Spiders_season" title="1899 Cleveland Spiders season">1899 Cleveland Spiders</a>).</p>
<p>Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-Neyer-25">[23]</a>^ and the new owners tried to change the team&rsquo;s image by renaming it the <strong>Boston Bees</strong>. This did little to change the team&rsquo;s fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Perini" title="Lou Perini">Lou Perini</a>, changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spahn" title="Warren Spahn">Warren Spahn</a> to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Warren_Spahn_Pitching_transparency_1952_March_21.png"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Warren_Spahn_Pitching_transparency_1952_March_21.png/220px-Warren_Spahn_Pitching_transparency_1952_March_21.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Hall of Fame pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spahn" title="Warren Spahn">Warren Spahn</a></p>
<p>In 1948, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Boston_Braves_season" title="1948 Boston Braves season">team</a> won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Sain" title="Johnny Sain">Johnny Sain</a>, who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, <em>Boston Post</em> writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:</p>
<p><em>First we&rsquo;ll use Spahn</em></p>
<p><em>then we&rsquo;ll use Sain</em></p>
<p><em>Then an off day</em></p>
<p><em>followed by rain</em></p>
<p><em>Back will come Spahn</em></p>
<p><em>followed by Sain</em></p>
<p><em>And followed</em></p>
<p><em>we hope</em></p>
<p><em>by two days of rain.</em></p>
<p>The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as <em>&ldquo;Spahn and Sain and pray for rain&rdquo;</em>, entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves had the same overall winning percentage as in games that Spahn and Sain started.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_World_Series" title="1948 World Series">1948 World Series</a>, which the Braves lost in six games to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Cleveland_Indians_season" title="1948 Cleveland Indians season">Indians</a>, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jethroe" title="Sam Jethroe">Sam Jethroe</a> became the team&rsquo;s first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, where the Braves had their top farm club, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers_minor_league" title="Milwaukee Brewers minor league">Brewers</a>. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Veeck" title="Bill Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> had tried to return his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_St._Louis_Browns" title="History of the St. Louis Browns">St. Louis Browns</a> there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.</p>
