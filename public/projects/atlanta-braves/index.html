<p>An away jersey worn by Hank Aaron in 1969.</p>
<p>The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85&ndash;77 in 1966, 77&ndash;85 in 1967, and 81&ndash;81 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West" title="1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season">National League West</a> Division title, before being swept by the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season" title="1969 New York Mets season">Miracle Mets</a>&rdquo; in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_National_League_Championship_Series">National League Championship Series</a>. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 &ndash; in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aaron_715.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Aaron_715.jpg/170px-Aaron_715.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aaron_715.jpg" title="Enlarge"></a></p>
<p>The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Parc_Stadium" title="Center Parc Stadium">Center Parc Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Hank Aaron</a>. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (&ldquo;The Launching Pad&rdquo;), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Carty">Rico Carty</a> (in 1970) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Garr" title="Ralph Garr">Ralph Garr</a> (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron&rsquo;s historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Evans" title="Darrell Evans">Darrell Evans</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davey_Johnson" title="Davey Johnson">Davey Johnson</a> along with Aaron.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth&rsquo;s record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. On April 4, opening day of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="1974 Major League Baseball season">next season</a>, he hit No.714 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cincinnati_Reds_season" title="1974 Cincinnati Reds season">Cincinnati</a>, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth&rsquo;s mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Downing_(baseball)" title="Al Downing (baseball)">Al Downing</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season" title="1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers" title="Milwaukee Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> on November 2, 1974.</p>

<p>Media magnate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a> purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a>, owner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstation" title="Superstation">superstation</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_(TV_network)" title="TBS (TV network)">WTBS</a>, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton_County_Stadium" title="Atlanta--Fulton County Stadium">Atlanta&ndash;Fulton County Stadium</a>. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)" title="Manager (baseball)">manager</a>, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Atlanta_Braves_season" title="1977 Atlanta Braves season">Braves</a> lost 2&ndash;1 to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season" title="1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> to bring their losing streak to 17 games).</p>
<p>Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as &ldquo;The Atlanta Braves: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Team" title="America's Team">America&rsquo;s Team</a>&rdquo;, a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">the South</a>. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname &ldquo;Channel&rdquo; for pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Messersmith" title="Andy Messersmith">Andy Messersmith</a> and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braves_TBS_Baseball" title="Braves TBS Baseball">Braves games</a>. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.</p>

<p>After three straight losing seasons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Cox" title="Bobby Cox">Bobby Cox</a> was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Murphy" title="Dale Murphy">Dale Murphy</a> into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Torre">Joe Torre</a>, under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969.

Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league&rsquo;s best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)" title="General manager (baseball)">general manager</a>.

The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65&ndash;97. They traded Dale Murphy to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player.

The &ldquo;Worst to First&rdquo; Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season" title="1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in a very tightly contested seven-game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_National_League_Championship_Series" title="1991 National League Championship Series">NLCS</a> only to lose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_World_Series" title="1991 World Series">World Series</a>, also in seven games, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Minnesota_Twins_season" title="1991 Minnesota Twins season">Minnesota Twins</a>.

<p>In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. The 14 consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Betemit" title="Wilson Betemit">Wilson Betemit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McCann_(baseball)" title="Brian McCann (baseball)">Brian McCann</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Orr" title="Pete Orr">Pete Orr</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Langerhans" title="Ryan Langerhans">Ryan Langerhans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Francoeur" title="Jeff Francoeur">Jeff Francoeur</a>).^[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]^ Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Davies_(baseball)" title="Kyle Davies (baseball)">Kyle Davies</a> all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta.

<p>In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6&ndash;21 record during June, the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935_Boston_Braves_season" title="1935 Boston Braves season">Boston Braves</a> in May 1935 (4&ndash;20) with a .166 winning percentage.</p>
<p>After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1897_Boston_Beaneaters_season" title="1897 Boston Beaneaters season">Boston Beaneaters</a> totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 &ndash; June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_New_York_Yankees_season" title="1930 New York Yankees season">1930 New York Yankees</a> to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8&ndash;3 victory over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Cincinnati_Reds_season" title="2006 Cincinnati Reds season">Cincinnati</a> on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Waner" title="Paul Waner">Paul Waner</a>&rsquo;s 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-34">[32]</a>^</p>
<p>However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Florida_Marlins_season" title="2006 Florida Marlins season">Florida Marlins</a> mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East.

Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_James" title="Chuck James">Chuck James</a> besting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens" title="Roger Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>, Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79&ndash;83.</p>

<p>Chipper Jones salutes the crowd at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Field" title="Turner Field">Turner Field</a> prior to his final regular-season game on September 30, 2012. Jones announced he would retire after 19 seasons with the Braves</p>
<p>In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones" title="Chipper Jones">Chipper Jones</a> would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-59">[57]</a>^ The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Lowe" title="Derek Lowe">Derek Lowe</a>, shortstop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_Gonz%C3%A1lez_(shortstop,_born_1977)" title="Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)">Alex González</a>, and outfielder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_McLouth" title="Nate McLouth">Nate McLouth</a>. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bourn" title="Michael Bourn">Michael Bourn</a>, along with shortstops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Pastornicky" title="Tyler Pastornicky">Tyler Pastornicky</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrelton_Simmons" title="Andrelton Simmons">Andrelton Simmons</a>. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Beachy" title="Brandon Beachy">Brandon Beachy</a>), manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Medlen" title="Kris Medlen">Kris Medlen</a> to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals" title="Washington Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild-card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_National_League_Wild_Card_Game" title="2012 National League Wild Card Game">playoff game</a> before entering into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_Series" title="Division Series">Division Series</a>.</p>

The Braves were behind 6&ndash;3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder. Umpire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Holbrook" title="Sam Holbrook">Sam Holbrook</a> called Simmons out, citing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_fly_rule" title="Infield fly rule">infield fly rule</a>. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6&ndash;3, ending their season.</p>

The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.J._Upton" title="B.J. Upton">B.J.

The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward" title="Jason Heyward">Jason Heyward</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McCann_(baseball)" title="Brian McCann (baseball)">Brian McCann</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman" title="Freddie Freeman">Freddie Freeman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_O%27Flaherty" title="Eric O'Flaherty">Eric O&rsquo;Flaherty</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Venters" title="Jonny Venters">Jonny Venters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiro_Pena" title="Ramiro Pena">Ramiro Pena</a> and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team. Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman Freddie Freeman was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play. The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Teher%C3%A1n" title="Julio Teherán">Julio Teherán</a> after much hype during Spring training. From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves#cite_note-62">[60]</a>^ The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April&ndash;May 2000.</p>
