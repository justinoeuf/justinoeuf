        <p>In grade school, the first page of my class notebooks was always written in deliberate, delicate handwriting and neat page formatting. There were times when, despite our class having already progressed a week or two into the semester, I delayed writing anything down until the day came when the class’s content/lecture was “right” enough for me to markup the first page. To err on the first page was to sully the entire semester!</p>
<p>This youthful behavior was, of course, mostly trivial. But I think some can relate to that underlying anxiousness, the fear of taking an irreversible misstep before beginning something that holds a certain level personal significance. It&rsquo;s especially true for these current adult-ing things we do now that are beyond the privacy of a notebook, in the public square, and having once begun, cannot be easily re-raveled. (made up that last word)</p>
<p>ALERT: I promise this isn&rsquo;t a meta post about my &ldquo;journey&rdquo; of starting this blog. Not only would that have been trope-y, but also lazy and embarrassing and good thing it only crossed my mind once.</p>
<p>This week marks two years since moving to Houston post-college, and my irreversible first step is now already few paces behind me. The only thing is, I don’t know where I’m going, nor do I really know where I am yikes oops whoops. Comfortingly, I’m among peers where this feeling is not uncommon – uncertainty also loves company, maybe. But I&rsquo;m undecided on how to feel about this part: I think any of the alternative steps I could’ve taken two years ago would have ultimately led me to this same non-place place.</p>
<p>Which means that a prior step was a misstep? Or maybe the recent steps have been a loop? Or I should stop using this metaphor? I don’t know. I’m hopeful that this un-place will actually prove to be a waypoint, and if so, I can only make myself ready for what’s further along.</p>
